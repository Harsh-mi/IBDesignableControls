This package contains the UIView extension and you can use the proeprties of the UIControls directly from the storyboard once you install this package.
Just take any UIControl element like UILabel, UIButton, UIImageView, etc. and check the Attributed inspector.

- There will be corner radius, border color, border width, only top corner radius, only left corner radius, only right corner radius, only bottom corner radius properties which you can access directly from Storyboard.

- For example here is the attached screen shot of the Attributed inspector with Designable properties.

- Here if you can set either full conrner radius or just top, right, left and bottom corner radius at a time if you set both then it will take full corner radius value by default.
